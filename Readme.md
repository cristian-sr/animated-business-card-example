# Animated Business Card - Example

Is an excellent way to boost your HTML and CSS skills by developing a solid understanding of CSS positioning with a one-page website.

That’s because you’ll be using more sophisticated design and layout techniques, including CSS3 features that are widely used in modern web design.

But what are we doing?

Well, in this HTML project, you'll create a digital business card. 

While this might seem simple, it’s actually a solid step up in complexity.

This is because you’ll be using more advanced CSS to style and position elements by getting to grips with the Flexbox layout model.

This is ideal if you want to enhance your design skills with advanced styling techniques.

Here’s what you can expect to learn from this project:

- Flexbox: Learn how to use Flexbox for creating flexible and responsive layouts that work on different screen sizes
- CSS Transitions and Transforms: Add visual interest with hover effects that transform elements, such as changing their scale or rotating them.
- CSS Positioning: Use advanced positioning techniques to layer elements.
- Box Model Manipulation: Apply margins, paddings, and borders.
- Styling and Theming: Develop a visual theme using colors, fonts, and spacing.
- Interactivity: Enhance the UX with pseudo-classes to make your card interactive when users hover over elements.
